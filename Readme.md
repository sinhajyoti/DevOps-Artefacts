This repository is aimed at providing easy-to-apply tutorials from practical experience for various Dev-Ops automation.
Tools used primarily involve Docker, Ansible,Vagrant, Consul and some bit of Packer.

Before using these tutorials, knowledge and working of VirtualBox with Ubuntu is required as all the tutorials use VirtualBox loaded with Ubuntu Operating System.

Good luck!
